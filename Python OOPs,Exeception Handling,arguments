1.What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Answer: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, 
which are instances of classes. It allows for the modeling of real-world entities using attributes (data) and methods (functions).  

2.What are the four main principles of OOP?
Answer: The four main principles of OOP are:
   Encapsulation:The process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single entity is known as Encapsulation. e.g., a class.
   Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
   Inheritance: Creating a new class from an existing class, inheriting fields and methods.
   Polymorphism: The ability of different classes to respond to the same function call in different ways.
    The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

3.What is a class in Python?
Answer: A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.

4.What is an object in Python?
Answer: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on the class blueprint that has attributes and methods defined by the class.

5.What is encapsulation in OOP?
Answer: Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which is a way of preventing accidental interference and misuse.

6.How do you achieve encapsulation in Python?
Answer: In Python, encapsulation is achieved using private and protected access modifiers. A single underscore _ prefix makes an attribute protected, and a double underscore __ prefix makes it private.

7.What is inheritance in OOP?
Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits attributes and methods from an existing class. The new class is called the derived (or child) class, and the existing class is called the base (or parent) class.

8.What is polymorphism in OOP?
Answer: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. It can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

9.What is method overloading?
Answer: Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class. Python does not support traditional method overloading as seen in other languages.

10.What is method overriding?
Answer: Method overriding occurs when a derived class defines a method that is already defined in its base class with the same name and parameters. It allows the derived class to provide a specific implementation of the method.

11.What is an abstract class?
Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can have abstract methods that must be implemented by the subclasses.
A class that contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.

What is an interface in OOP?
Answer: An interface defines a contract of methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits the interface. Python does not have a built-in interface mechanism like Java, but similar behavior can be achieved using abstract base classes.

12.What is multiple inheritance?
Answer: Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.

13.What is the difference between a class and an object?
Answer: A class is a blueprint for objects, defining attributes and methods. An object is an instance of a class, with specific values for attributes defined by the class.

14.What is the difference between composition and inheritance?
Answer: Inheritance is a "is-a" relationship where a class inherits from a parent class. Composition is a "has-a" relationship where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes.

15.What is a constructor in Python?
Answer: A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is instantiated. In Python, the constructor method is __init__().

16.What is the difference between __init__ and __new__ in Python?
Answer: __init__ initializes a new object after it has been created, whereas __new__ is responsible for creating a new instance of a class.

17.What is a destructor in Python?
Answer: A destructor is a method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. In Python, it is defined using __del__().

18.What is the purpose of self in Python?
Answer: self is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access variables and methods associated with the instance.

19.Can you explain the concept of static methods in Python?
Answer: A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class. It does not modify object state and is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.

20.What are class methods in Python?
Answer: Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator and take cls as the first parameter.

21.What is the difference between class methods and static methods?
Answer: Class methods receive a reference to the class (cls) as the first parameter, allowing them to modify class state. Static methods do not receive an implicit first argument and cannot modify object or class state.

22.What is a metaclass in Python?
Answer: A metaclass is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.

23.What is duck typing in Python?
Answer: Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. If an object behaves like a duck (supports certain methods and operations), it can be used as a duck.

24.How is data hiding achieved in Python?
Answer: Data hiding is achieved using private variables, which are prefixed with double underscores (__). This makes them inaccessible from outside the class.

25.What is operator overloading?
Answer: Operator overloading is the ability to define how operators (+, -, etc.) behave with user-defined types. In Python, this is done by defining special methods like __add__, __sub__, etc.

26.What is the purpose of the super() function in Python?
Answer: The super() function is used to call the method of the parent class. It is commonly used to extend the functionality of inherited methods.

27.What is method resolution order (MRO) in Python?
Answer: Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. It is especially important in multiple inheritance to determine the method calling order.

28.What is the use of the __repr__ method in Python?
Answer: The __repr__ method is used to provide a string representation of an object that is useful for debugging. It is called by the repr() function and the interactive interpreter.

29.How does Python handle memory management in OOP?
Answer: Python uses automatic memory management, with garbage collection to reclaim memory used by objects that are no longer needed. It uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collector to manage memory efficiently.

1. What are exceptions in Python?
Answer: Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of instructions. They are used to handle errors and unexpected situations.

2. How do you handle exceptions using try, except, and finally blocks?
Answer: You use a try block to enclose code that may raise an exception. If an exception occurs, the except block is executed to handle it. The finally block, if present, is executed afterward regardless of whether an exception occurred.

3. Explain the purpose of the raise statement in Python.
Answer: The raise statement is used to manually raise an exception. You can raise built-in exceptions or create custom exceptions by inheriting from the Exception class.

4. What is the except clause without an exception type used for?
Answer: An except clause without an exception type is used as a catch-all to handle any exception that may occur. It is often used as a final exception handler when specific exception types are not known.

5. What is the difference between the except and else blocks in exception handling?
Answer: The except block is executed when an exception occurs, and you specify the exception type to catch. The else block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block.

6. How can you handle multiple exceptions in a single except block?
Answer: You can handle multiple exceptions by specifying them as a tuple in a single except block, like this: except (ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2) as e:.

7. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?
Answer: The finally block is used to define code that must be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It’s often used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources.

8.Explain the concept of custom exceptions in Python.
Answer: Custom exceptions are user-defined exception classes that inherit from the Exception class. They allow you to create specialized exceptions for your applications.

9. What is the difference between the try...except and try...except...else blocks?
Answer: The try...except block is used to catch and handle exceptions. The try...except...else block also includes an else block that is executed when no exceptions occur.

10. How can you handle exceptions raised in a function that you call within a try block?
Answer: You can catch exceptions raised in a function called within a try block by adding an inner try...except block within the outer one.

11. What is the purpose of the assert statement in Python?
Answer: The assert statement is used to check if a given condition is True. If the condition is False, an AssertionError exception is raised.

12. Explain the difference between a built-in exception and a custom exception.
Answer: Built-in exceptions are provided by Python and cover a wide range of common error conditions. Custom exceptions are user-defined and are tailored to specific application requirements.

13. How do you re-raise an exception in Python?
Answer: You can re-raise an exception by using the raise statement without any arguments within an except block. This re-raises the currently caught exception.

14. What is the purpose of the try...finally block in exception handling?
Answer: The try...finally block ensures that code within the finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It’s commonly used for resource cleanup.

15. Explain the difference between the assert statement and exception handling.
Answer: The assert statement is used for debugging and testing to check conditions that should always be True. Exception handling is used for handling runtime errors and exceptions that may occur during normal program execution.

16. How do you handle exceptions with multiple except blocks in Python?
Answer: You can handle exceptions with multiple except blocks by specifying different exception types for each block. Python will execute the first except block that matches the raised exception.

17. What is the purpose of the try...except...finally block in exception handling?
Answer: The try...except...finally block combines error handling (try...except) with cleanup (finally) to ensure that resources are properly released even in the presence of exceptions.

18. How can you customize error messages when raising exceptions in Python?
Answer: You can include a message as an argument when raising an exception, like this: raise ExceptionType("Custom error message").

19. What is the purpose of the sys.exc_info() function in Python?
Answer: The sys.exc_info() function returns information about the current exception being handled, including the exception type, value, and traceback.

20. How do you handle exceptions raised by external libraries in Python?
Answer: You can handle exceptions raised by external libraries by using try...except blocks and specifying the expected exception types. Additionally, you can check the library’s documentation for specific exceptions.

21. Explain the purpose of the with statement in Python for exception handling.
Answer: The with statement is used for context management, ensuring that resources are properly acquired and released, even in the presence of exceptions.

22. What is the finally block used for in exception handling?
Answer: The finally block is used to define code that must be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It’s often used for cleanup tasks.

23. How can you handle exceptions of unknown types in Python?
Answer: You can handle exceptions of unknown types using a catch-all except block without specifying an exception type.

24. What is the purpose of the try...except...else...finally block in exception handling?
Answer: The try...except...else...finally block combines exception handling (try...except) with code that runs when no exceptions occur (else) and code that always runs (finally).

25. What is the difference between the except and finally blocks in exception handling?
Answer: The except block is used to handle exceptions. The finally block is used for cleanup code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

26. How do you raise a custom exception with a specific error message in Python?
Answer: To raise a custom exception with a specific error message, create an instance of the custom exception class and pass the message as an argument to the exception constructor.

27. What is the purpose of the try...except...else block in exception handling?
Answer: The try...except...else block allows you to specify code that runs when no exceptions are raised in the try block. It’s used for code that should only execute when there are no exceptions.

28. Explain the difference between the except block with multiple exception types and multiple except blocks.
 Answer: The except block with multiple exception types catches any of the specified exceptions. Multiple except blocks allow you to handle each exception type differently.

29. What is the purpose of the try...except...else...finally block in Python exception handling?
Answer: The try...except...else...finally block combines error handling (try...except), code that runs when no exceptions occur (else), and cleanup code (finally).

30. How can you handle exceptions in a specific order when multiple except blocks are used?
Answer: When multiple except blocks are used, Python will execute the first except block that matches the raised exception. You can order the except blocks based on the most specific exceptions first.

31. What happens if an exception is raised in the finally block in Python?
Answer: If an exception is raised in the finally block, it will replace any exception that may have been raised in the try or except blocks. The new exception will propagate unless caught.

32. What is the purpose of the try...except...else...finally block in Python?
Answer: The try...except...else...finally block provides a comprehensive structure for handling exceptions, executing code when no exceptions occur (else), and ensuring cleanup (finally).

33. How do you create and raise a custom exception class in Python?
Answer: To create and raise a custom exception class, define a new class that inherits from the Exception class or one of its subclasses. You can then raise instances of this custom exception class.

Answer: The try...except...else...finally block combines error handling (try...except), code that runs when no exceptions occur (else), and cleanup code (finally).

35. How do you handle exceptions in a specific order when using multiple except blocks?
Answer: When using multiple except blocks, Python executes the first except block that matches the raised exception. You can order the except blocks based on the most specific exceptions first.

36. What happens if an exception is raised in the finally block in Python?
Answer: If an exception is raised in the finally block, it will replace any exception that may have been raised in the try or except blocks. The new exception will propagate unless caught.

37. What is the purpose of the try...except...else...finally block in Python?
Answer: The try...except...else...finally block provides a comprehensive structure for handling exceptions, executing code when no exceptions occur (else), and ensuring cleanup (finally).

38. How do you create and raise a custom exception class in Python?
Answer: To create and raise a custom exception class, define a new class that inherits from the Exception class or one of its subclasses. You can then raise instances of this custom exception class.

39. What is the difference between the assert statement and exception handling in Python?
Answer: The assert statement is used for debugging and testing, while exception handling is used to handle errors and exceptional conditions during program execution.

40. What is the purpose of the try...except block in Python exception handling?
Answer: The try...except block is used to catch and handle exceptions that may occur within the try block.

41. How can you specify an action when an exception is not caught in Python?
Answer: You can specify an action when an exception is not caught by using an except block without an exception type, known as a catch-all or generic except block.

42. What is the use of the finally block in exception handling?
Answer: The finally block is used to define code that must be executed, whether an exception occurs or not. It’s often used for cleanup tasks.

43. How do you raise a custom exception in Python?
Answer: You can raise a custom exception by creating an instance of the custom exception class and using the raise statement.

44. What is the purpose of the try...except...else block in Python?

1.Default Arguments:
Explanation: Default arguments are parameters in a function that have a default value assigned to them. If no value is provided for these parameters during function invocation, the default value is used.

                                       def greet(name='Guest'):
                                           print(f"Hello, {name}!")
                                       
                                       greet()          # Output: Hello, Guest!
                                       greet('Alice')   # Output: Hello, Alice!
2.Keyword Arguments:
Explanation: Keyword arguments are passed to a function with the parameter name followed by the value. This allows you to specify arguments in any order, and also allows you to skip some arguments by providing values only for the parameters you want to override.

                                       def greet(name, age):
                                           print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
                                       
                                       greet(age=25, name='Alice')   # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.

3.Positional Arguments:
Explanation: Positional arguments are passed to a function based on their position or order in the function signature. They are assigned to parameters in the order they are provided.

                                       def greet(name, age):
                                           print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
                                       
                                       greet('Bob', 30)   # Output: Hello, Bob! You are 30 years old.

4.Arbitrary Positional Arguments (Variable-Length Positional Arguments):
Explanation: These are function parameters that allow you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. They are denoted by an asterisk (*) before the parameter name.

                                       def sum_numbers(*args):
                                           total = 0
                                           for num in args:
                                               total += num
                                           return total
                                       
                                       print(sum_numbers(1, 2, 3))   # Output: 6
5.Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (Variable-Length Keyword Arguments):
Explanation: These are function parameters that allow you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. They are denoted by two asterisks (**) before the parameter name.

                                       def greet(**kwargs):
                                           for key, value in kwargs.items():
                                               print(f"{key}: {value}")
                                       
                                       greet(name='Alice', age=25)   # Output: name: Alice \n age: 25

1.How memory is managed in Python?
Ans:Python memory is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have an access to this private heap and interpreter takes care of this Python private heap. The allocation of Python heap space for Python objects is done by Python memory manager.

2.What are Python decorators ?
A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are typically applied to functions, and they play a crucial role in enhancing or modifying the behavior of functions.

A Python decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function. The new function can then be used to replace the original function. Decorators are often used to add additional functionality to existing functions

3.what is python generator?
A Python generator function is a function that can be used to generate a sequence of values. Generator functions are similar to regular functions, but they use the yield keyword instead of the return keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator object

4.diff range and xrange.
One of the key differences between range() and xrange() lies in their memory usage. Since range() generates a list, it consumes more memory, especially when dealing with a large sequence of numbers. On the other hand, xrange() generates numbers on demand, making it a more memory-friendly option.

5.diff deepcopy and shallowcopy
shallow copy:Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address.
             Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.
             A shallow copy is faster.
deep copy:Deep copy stores copies of the object’s value.
          Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.
          Deep copy is comparatively slower.
6.define For Loop?
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

7.define while Loop?
while loop is used to execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
