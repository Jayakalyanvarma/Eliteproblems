Stucture of operating System.

Monolithic Structure:-
Description: All OS services (e.g., file system management, process management, memory management) are implemented in a single, large kernel.

Layered Structure:-
Description: The OS is divided into a number of layers (levels), each built on top of lower layers. Each layer only interacts with the layers directly below and above it.

microkernel"-
A microkernel is a type of operating system kernel that is designed to provide only the most basic services required for an operating system to function, such as memory management and process scheduling.

Modular Structure:-
n an OS, a modular structure is an architecture where the system is divided into independent, interchangeable modules,each handling specific functions and interacting through defined interfaces.

What is preemptive and non preemptive Scheduling.
A preemptive scheduling algorithm is a type of CPU scheduling in which the operating system can interrupt and suspend a currently running process to allocate CPU time to another process.

in non-preemptive scheduling, any new process has to wait until the running process finishes its execution CPU cycle.
what is PCB?
A Process Control Block in OS (PCB) is a data structure used by the operating system to manage information about a process.
It contains information about the process state, memory allocation, CPU usage, I/O devices, and other resources used by the process.

What is IPC?-Inter Process Communication.
IPC is a mechanism provided by the operating system to allow processes to communicate and synchronize with each other. It enables data exchange, coordination, and synchronization between processes running concurrently.

What are the primary types of communication in IPC?
Answer: The primary types of communication in IPC are message passing and shared memory.

Explain the difference between message passing and shared memory IPC.
Answer: Message passing involves processes exchanging messages through the OS, whereas shared memory allows processes to share a region of memory for direct communication.

Explain the concept of sockets in IPC.
Answer: Sockets are endpoints for communication between processes running on the same or different systems over a network. They provide bidirectional communication, allowing processes to exchange data reliably. Sockets can be used for IPC on the same system (UNIX domain sockets) or between different systems (network sockets).



2.Explain types of OS?

Batch os:
  A batch Processing Operating System (BatchOS) is an open-source operating system designed to manage multiple jobs in sequence.without     user interaction.
  Uses: Ideal for large-scale data processing tasks such as payroll, billing systems, and scientific computations where jobs are         
        repetitive and require minimal user interaction.
  
Time-Sharing OS:
  Explanation: Allows multiple users to access the system simultaneously by allocating processor time to each user.

  Program	                                                                                     Process
Program contains a set of instructions designed to complete a specific task.	      Process is an instance of an executing program.

Program is a static entity.	                                                          Process is a dynamic entity.

4.Explain Process States?
  New:
  Explanation: The process is being created.
  Details: When a process is first initiated, it is in the "new" state. It has not yet started execution.
  
  Ready:
  Explanation: The process is ready to run but is waiting for CPU time.
  Details: Once the process is created, it moves to the "ready" state, where it waits in a queue for its turn to be executed by the CPU.
  
  Running:
  Explanation: The process is currently being executed by the CPU.
  Details: When the process scheduler assigns CPU time to a process, it transitions from the "ready" state to the "running" state.
  
  Blocked (or Waiting):
  Explanation: The process is waiting for an event to occur (such as I/O completion).
  Details: If a process needs to wait for resources, like input/output operations, it enters the "blocked" state until the required 
  event occurs.
  
  Terminated:
  Explanation: The process has finished execution.
  Details: After a process completes its execution or is terminated by the operating system, it moves to the "terminated" state, where 
  it waits to be removed from the process table.

5.Explain different Types of scheduling Algorithms?
  1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling:
  Description: Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. The CPU is allocated to the first process in the 
  queue, which runs until it completes or is blocked.
  Advantages: Simple to implement.
  
  2. Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling:
  Description: The process with the shortest burst time (execution time) is selected for execution next. Also known as Shortest Job 
  First (SJF).
  Advantages: Minimizes average waiting time and turnaround time.
  
  3. Round Robin (RR) Scheduling:
  Description:Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is cyclically assigned a fixed time slot. It is the 
  preemptive version of the First come First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm. 
  Advantages: Fairness in resource allocation, prevents starvation.
  
  4. Priority Scheduling:
  Description: Each process is assigned a priority, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority. Processes with 
  the same priority are scheduled using FCFS.
  Advantages: Allows for different levels of priority for different processes, suitable for real-time systems.

6.what is process Synchronization?
  Process synchronization in OS is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in such a way that no two processes can access 
  the same shared data and resources.

7.what is DeadLock?
  A Deadlock is a situation where each of the computer process waits for a resource which is being assigned to some another process. In 
  this situation, none of the process gets executed

8.Explain the conditions necessary for a deadlock to occur.
  four necessary conditions for dead lock occur.
  1.Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for another resource
  
  2.Mutual Exclusion: one or more than one resources are non sharable-only one process can use it
  
  3.NO Preemption:A resource cannot taken from a process unless the process release the resource
  
  4.Circular Wait:A set of process are waiting for each other in circular form.

9. how can you prevent from dead lock?
  deadlock can be prevented by eliminating any of the four necessary conditions, which are mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no 
  preemption, and circular wait. 

10.what are deadlock avoidance Algorithm?
  Deadlock avoidance algorithms are techniques used to dynamically allocate resources to processes in such a way that deadlocks are 
  prevented from  occurring.
  1. Banker's Algorithm:
  Description: Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation algorithm that ensures that the system will never enter a deadlock state by 
  carefully managing the allocation of resources.
  2. Resource Allocation Graph (RAG):
  Description: Resource Allocation Graph is a graphical representation used to track the allocation and request of resources by 
  processes.

11.explain dead lock recovery Algorithms?
  Deadlock recovery algorithms are techniques used to recover from deadlock situations once they have occurred.
  1. Process Termination and Rollback:
  Description: In this approach, one or more processes involved in the deadlock are selected for termination. The terminated processes 
  release their held resources, allowing other processes to continue execution.
  Rollback: If a process is terminated, its state may need to be rolled back to a safe checkpoint to maintain consistency.
  2. Resource Preemption:
  Description: Resources held by processes involved in the deadlock are forcibly preempted and allocated to other processes.

Process synchronization:-
Process synchronization in OS is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in such a way that no two processes can access the same shared data and resources.
Example Scenario:
Consider two processes trying to access a shared printer. Process synchronization ensures that only one process prints at a time, preventing conflicts and ensuring the printer's correct operation.

Critical Section:
Critical section is the part of the code where shared resources are accessed.
It's crucial to ensure that only one process/thread accesses the critical section at a time to prevent data corruption.

Starvation:
Starvation occurs when a process is unable to proceed because other processes continually access the critical section.
Synchronization mechanisms should avoid starvation.

Explain critical section problem with sample example?
The critical section refers to a specific part of a program where shared resources are accessed, and concurrent execution may lead to conflicts or inconsistencies.
In a cafeteria scenario, where multiple people are trying to access a limited number of food stations, synchronization is necessary to avoid overcrowding at any one station and ensure fair access to all diners.



12.explain semaphores?
Semaphores are integer variables that are used to solve the critical section problem by using two atomic operations, wait and signal that are used for process synchronization.
Wait (P) Operation: Decrements the semaphore value, blocking the process if the value becomes zero.
Signal (V) Operation: Increments the semaphore value, unblocking a waiting process if any.

Binary semaphores: Can only have two values, 0 or 1, and are also known as mutex locks. They are used to control access to a single resource, such as a printer, Mutex: Blocks processes when locked (0), allows one process to proceed when unlocked (1).

Counting semaphores: Can take on any nonnegative integer value. They are used to control access to multiple resources, such as resources with many copies

13.what is memory management?
  Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating a computer's main memory. It ensures that blocks of memory space are 
  properly managed and allocated so the operating system (OS), applications and other running processes.

Explain Swapping in Memory Management?
Swapping in an operating system refers to the process of moving data between main memory (RAM) and secondary storage .
Swapping has been subdivided into two concepts: swap-in and swap-out.
Swap-out is a technique for moving a process from RAM to the hard disc.
Swap-in is a method of transferring a program from a hard disc to main memory, or RAM.

Explain Continuous memory management?
Continuous memory management refers to a memory allocation technique where each process is allocated a single contiguous block of memory in the RAM. 
14.explain pagging?
 Paging is a storage mechanism used to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages.The main   idea behind the paging is to divide each process in the form of pages.

15.explain segmentation?
  Segmentation is a memory management technique in which the memory is divided into the variable size parts. Each part is known as a     
  segment which can be allocated to a process.
  The details about each segment are stored in a table called a segment table. Segment table is stored in one (or many) of the segments.
  Segment table contains mainly two information about segment:
  Base: It is the base address of the segment
  Limit: It is the length of the segment.

16.Why is virtual memory important?
Answer:Virtual memory is important for several reasons:
  Increases Program Size: It allows programs to run that require more memory than the physically available RAM.
  Isolation: It provides isolation between processes, enhancing system stability and security.
  Efficient Memory Use: It allows for more efficient use of physical memory by using techniques such as paging and segmentation.
  Multitasking: It supports multitasking, allowing multiple applications to run simultaneously by ensuring that each has sufficient 
  memory.

17.How does virtual memory work?
Answer:Virtual memory works by using a combination of hardware and software mechanisms:
  Paging: The memory is divided into fixed-sized blocks called pages. The OS keeps a mapping between virtual addresses used by a program 
  and physical addresses in memory.
  Page Table: Each process has a page table that keeps track of where virtual pages are stored in physical memory.
  Page Faults: When a program tries to access a page that is not currently in physical memory, a page fault occurs. The OS then 
  retrieves the page from secondary storage (like a hard drive) and places it into RAM.
  Swap Space: This is a portion of the hard drive that is used as an extension of RAM. When physical memory is full, inactive pages are 
  moved to swap space to free up RAM for active processes.
    


18.What is thrashing in the context of virtual memory?
Answer:Thrashing occurs when a system spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory than executing instructions. This happens when the system is over-committed with too many processes competing for memory, causing a high rate of page faults. The symptoms include high disk activity, slow system performance, and low CPU utilization. 

19.Explain the concept of demand paging.
Answer:Demand paging is a technique where pages of a program are only loaded into physical memory when they are needed (i.e., on demand), rather          than loading all pages at the start. When a process tries to access a page that is not in memory, a page fault occurs, and the OS loads the required page from disk into memory.

Explain Page replacement Algorithms?
Page replacement algorithms are used in operating systems to decide which page to swap out of memory when a new page needs to be brought in.

First In First Out (FIFO): This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal. 

Optimal: Replace the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future.

Least Recently Used: In this algorithm, page will be replaced which is least recently used. 



20.How does the operating system decide which page to swap out during a page replacement?
Answer:The OS uses a page replacement algorithm to decide which page to swap out when a page fault occurs and physical memory is full. Common page replacement algorithms include:
      FIFO (First-In, First-Out): The oldest page in memory is swapped out.
      LRU (Least Recently Used): The page that has not been used for the longest time is swapped out.
      Optimal: The page that will not be used for the longest time in the future is swapped out.

21.define Virtual Memory.
Virtual memory is a memory management technique.that allows a Computer to use more memory than is physically available by using a portion of the hard drive as an extension of RAM. It creates an illusion of a large, continuous memory space, enabling efficient multitasking and larger application handling without being limited by physical memory constraints.

TERMINOLOGY:-

Physical Memory (RAM): The actual hardware memory installed in the system.

Address Space:
Logical (Virtual) Address Space: Addresses used by a process.
Physical Address Space: Addresses used by the hardware (RAM).

Swap Space: A portion of the disk used to extend physical memory.

Shared Memory: A method for multiple processes to access the same physical memory for communication purposes.Shared memory is a memory shared between two or more processes.
