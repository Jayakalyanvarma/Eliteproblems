1.What is the JVM?
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an engine that provides a runtime environment to run Java applications. It converts Java bytecode into machine code.

2.What is the JRE?
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a set of software tools for development of Java applications. It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other components to run applications written in Java.

3.What is the JDK?
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit used to develop Java applications and applets. It includes the JRE and development tools such as the Java compiler and debugger.

4.what are the features of java?
Some key features of Java are:
Object-oriented
Platform-independent
Secure
Robust
Multithreaded
Portable

5.What is a Constructor in Java?
A constructor is a block of code used to initialize an object. It is called when an instance of an object is created. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

6.What is the purpose of the super keyword in Java?
The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the immediate parent class object. It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.

7.What is a final keyword in Java?
The final keyword in Java is used to restrict the user. It can be used for variables, methods, and classes.
final variable: Its value cannot be changed.
final method: Cannot be overridden.
final class: Cannot be subclassed.

8.What is the this keyword in Java?
The this keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.

9.What is the static keyword in Java?
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. It can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes.The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

10.Explain Static Method?
A static method is a method in Java that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class. Static methods are also known as class methods.
Static methods are declared with the static keyword. They can be called without creating an instance of the class.
Static methods can only access static variables and other static methods. They cannot access instance variables or instance methods.

11.What is multilevel Inheritance?
where a class is derived from another class, which is also derived from another class. This forms a chain of inheritance.

12.Hierarchical Inheritance
where multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.

13.How to you Implement multiple inheritance in java?
Implementing Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces.

14.Types of Binding in java?
static binding:
When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as static binding.
Dynamic binding:
When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding.

15.Java java instanceof operator?
The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).

16.Explain Interface in java.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.
