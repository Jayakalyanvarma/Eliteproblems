1.What is the JVM?
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an engine that provides a runtime environment to run Java applications. It converts Java bytecode into machine code.

2.What is the JRE?
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a set of software tools for development of Java applications. It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other components to run applications written in Java.

3.What is the JDK?
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit used to develop Java applications and applets. It includes the JRE and development tools such as the Java compiler and debugger.

4.what are the features of java?
Some key features of Java are:
Object-oriented
Platform-independent
Secure
Robust
Multithreaded
Portable

5.What is a Constructor in Java?
A constructor is a block of code used to initialize an object. It is called when an instance of an object is created. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

6.What is the purpose of the super keyword in Java?
The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the immediate parent class object. It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.

7.What is a final keyword in Java?
The final keyword in Java is used to restrict the user. It can be used for variables, methods, and classes.
final variable: Its value cannot be changed.
final method: Cannot be overridden.
final class: Cannot be subclassed.

8.What is the this keyword in Java?
The this keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.

9.What is the static keyword in Java?
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. It can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes.The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

10.Explain Static Method?
A static method is a method in Java that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class. Static methods are also known as class methods.
Static methods are declared with the static keyword. They can be called without creating an instance of the class.
Static methods can only access static variables and other static methods. They cannot access instance variables or instance methods.

11.What is multilevel Inheritance?
where a class is derived from another class, which is also derived from another class. This forms a chain of inheritance.

12.Hierarchical Inheritance
where multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.

13.How to you Implement multiple inheritance in java?
Implementing Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces.

14.Types of Binding in java?
static binding:
When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as static binding.
Dynamic binding:
When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding.

15.Java java instanceof operator?
The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).

16.Explain Interface in java.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.

multi threading in java
-------------------------
Thread:A Thread is a very light-weighted process, or we can say the smallest part of the process that allows a program to operate more efficiently by running multiple tasks simultaneously.

Multi Threading:Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

16.explain types of constructers in java?
There are two types of constructors in Java:
Default constructor (no-arg constructor):A constructor is called "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameter.
Parameterized constructor:A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.

17.explain string and stringBuffer in java:
Definition: String is a class in Java that represents an immutable sequence of characters. Once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed.
Defination:StringBuffer is mutable, allowing modifications like additions, deletions, and alterations without creating new objects each time.
Methods of the String class:
charAt(int index): Returns the character at the specified index.
length(): Returns the length of the string.
substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex): Returns a substring from the specified begin index to the end index (exclusive).
toLowerCase(): Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
toUpperCase(): Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.
isEmpty(): Returns true if the string is empty.

Methods of the StringBuffer class:
append(String str): Appends the specified string to the end of the buffer.
insert(int offset, String str): Inserts the specified string into the buffer at the specified position.
reverse(): Reverses the characters in the buffer.
replace(int start, int end, String str): Replaces characters in the buffer between the specified start and end indices with the specified string.

Explain Exception handling in Java?
try-catch-finally:
The try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception.
The catch block is used to handle the exception. It catches the exception thrown by the try block.
The finally block is used to execute important code such as closing resources, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It executes after the try block or after the catch block.

The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code.
throws is a keyword in Java that is used in the signature of a method to indicate that this method might throw one of the listed type exceptions.
