1.What is Normalization?
  Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
  Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.
  Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.
  The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.

Data modification anomalies can be categorized into three types:
  Insertion Anomaly: Insertion Anomaly refers to when one cannot insert a new tuple into a relationship due to lack of data.
  Deletion Anomaly: The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.
  Updatation Anomaly: The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.

What is Multivalued Dependency?
When one attribute in a database depends on another attribute and has many independent values, it is said to have multivalued dependency (MVD).

Types of Join Dependency

There are two types of Join Dependencies:
Lossless Join Dependency:
          It means that whenever the join occurs between the tables, then no information should be lost, the new table must have all the content in the original table.
Lossy Join Dependency: 
          In this type of join dependency, data loss may occur at some point in time which includes the absence of a tuple from the original table or duplicate tuples within the database.


Normal Form	      Description

1NF	              A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
2NF	              A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.This means that each column should be directly                        related to the primary key, and not to other columns.
3NF	              A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.
BCNF	            A stronger definition of 3NF is known as Boyce Codd's normal form.
4NF	              A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd's normal form and has no multi-valued dependency.
5NF	              A relation is in 5NF. If it is in 4NF and does not contain any join dependency, joining should be lossless.
