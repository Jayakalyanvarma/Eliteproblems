1.What is Normalization?
  Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
  Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.
  Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.
  The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.

Data modification anomalies can be categorized into three types:
  Insertion Anomaly: Insertion Anomaly refers to when one cannot insert a new tuple into a relationship due to lack of data.
  Deletion Anomaly: The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.
  Updatation Anomaly: The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.

What is Multivalued Dependency?
When one attribute in a database depends on another attribute and has many independent values, it is said to have multivalued dependency (MVD).

Types of Join Dependency

There are two types of Join Dependencies:
Lossless Join Dependency:
          It means that whenever the join occurs between the tables, then no information should be lost, the new table must have all the content in the original table.
Lossy Join Dependency: 
          In this type of join dependency, data loss may occur at some point in time which includes the absence of a tuple from the original table or duplicate tuples within the database.


Normal Form	      Description

1NF	              A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
2NF	              A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.This means that each column should be directly                        related to the primary key, and not to other columns.
3NF	              A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.
BCNF	            A stronger definition of 3NF is known as Boyce Codd's normal form.
4NF	              A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd's normal form and has no multi-valued dependency.
5NF	              A relation is in 5NF. If it is in 4NF and does not contain any join dependency, joining should be lossless.


2.What is a View?
  View is a virtual table in which the records are not stored explicitly, 
  In DBMS, a view is a virtual table that provides a way to present data from one or more tables through a single query without storing the data itself.

What is a materialized view?
A materialized view is a duplicate data table created by combining data from multiple existing tables for faster data retrieval.

what is stored procedure?
A stored procedure in SQL is a group of SQL queries that can be saved and reused multiple times. It is very useful as it reduces the need for rewriting SQL queries. It enhances efficiency, reusability, and security in database management.

SET OPERATIONS IN DBMS:-

UNION: Combines the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set, removing duplicates.
Example: SELECT column1 FROM table1 UNION SELECT column2 FROM table2;

UNION ALL: Similar to UNION but includes all rows, including duplicates.
Example: SELECT column1 FROM table1 UNION ALL SELECT column2 FROM table2;

INTERSECT: Returns the common rows between the results of two SELECT queries.
Example: SELECT column1 FROM table1 INTERSECT SELECT column1 FROM table2;

MINUS: Returns the rows that are present in the first SELECT query but not in the second SELECT query.
Example: SELECT column1 FROM table1 EXCEPT SELECT column1 FROM table2;


explain various concurrency control techniques in dbms?
Concurrency control techniques in Database Management Systems (DBMS) ensure that transactions are executed correctly and concurrently without causing data inconsistency or loss. Here are various concurrency control techniques:

1. Lock-Based Concurrency Control:
Description: Transactions acquire locks on data items to ensure exclusive access.
Types:
Two-Phase Locking (2PL): Transactions acquire locks in two phases (growing phase and shrinking phase) and release them only in the shrinking phase.
Strict Two-Phase Locking (S2PL): Transactions hold all locks until the end of the transaction.

Timestamp-Based Concurrency Control:
Description: Assigns a unique timestamp to each transaction and data item to order transactions and resolve conflicts.
Types:
Timestamp Ordering Protocol (TO): Transactions are ordered based on their timestamps.
Thomas Write Rule: Determines which transaction's write operation should be chosen when there is a write-write conflict.
