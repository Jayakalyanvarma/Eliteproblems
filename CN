What is a computer network?
Answer: A computer network is a group of interconnected computers that communicate with each other and share resources, such as files, printers, and internet connections.

What are the types of computer networks?
Answer: The main types are Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), and Personal Area Network (PAN).
LAN(Local Area Network)
Local Area Network is a group of computers connected to each other in a small area such as building, office.
PAN(Personal Area Network)
Personal Area Network is a network arranged within an individual person, typically within a range of 10 meters.
MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)
A metropolitan area network is a network that covers a larger geographic area by interconnecting a different LAN to form a larger network.
WAN(Wide Area Network)
A Wide Area Network is a network that extends over a large geographical area such as states or countries.
A Wide Area Network is quite bigger network than the LAN.

what is network topology?
Network topology is the physical or logical arrangement of devices and connections in a network. It defines how devices are connected to each other and how data flows through the network.
Bus Topology:
Description: In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable, known as the bus or backbone.
Advantages:
Easy to install and extend.
Requires less cable than other topologies.
Disadvantages:
Difficult to troubleshoot.
A failure in the main cable stops all transmission.

Star Topology:
Description: In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. The hub acts as a repeater for data flow.
Advantages:
Easy to install and manage.
Failure of one node does not affect the rest of the network.
Easy to detect faults and to remove parts.
Disadvantages:
Requires more cable than bus topology.
If the central hub fails, the entire network is inoperative.
Higher cost due to the use of hub/switch.

Ring Topology:
Description: In a ring topology, each device is connected to two other devices, forming a circular pathway for signals. Data travels in one direction.
Advantages:
Data is transferred in a sequential manner, making it easy to manage.
Better performance than bus topology under heavy load.
Disadvantages:
A failure in any cable or device can disrupt the entire network.
Troubleshooting is difficult.
Adding or removing devices can cause issues.

Mesh Topology:
Description: In a mesh topology, each device is connected to every other device in the network. There are two types: full mesh and partial mesh.
Advantages:
Provides high redundancy and reliability.
Data can be transmitted simultaneously from different devices.
Easy to identify and isolate faults.
Disadvantages:
Requires a lot of cables and I/O ports, making it expensive.
Complex and difficult to install and configure.

Tree Topology:
Description: Tree topology is a combination of star and bus topologies. Groups of star-configured networks are connected to a linear bus backbone.
Advantages:
Supports future expandability of the network.
Fault isolation is easy.
Suitable for large networks.
Disadvantages:
If the backbone line breaks, the entire segment goes down.
More difficult to configure and wire than other topologies.

Hybrid Topology:
Description: A hybrid topology is a combination of two or more different types of topologies, designed to leverage the advantages of each.
Advantages:
Flexible and scalable.
Reliable due to the combination of topologies.

Answer:OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.
OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function. divided into seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

1.physical layer:
The main functionality of the physical layer is to transmit the individual bits from one node to another node.
It is the lowest layer of the OSI model.
Functions of a Physical layer:
Line Configuration: It defines the way how two or more devices can be connected physically.
Data Transmission: It defines the transmission mode whether it is simplex, half-duplex or full-duplex mode between the two devices on the network.
Topology: It defines the way how network devices are arranged.
Signals: It determines the type of the signal used for transmitting the information.

2.Data Link Layer:
This layer is responsible for the error-free transfer of data frames.
It defines the format of the data on the network.
It provides a reliable and efficient communication between two or more devices.
It is mainly responsible for the unique identification of each device that resides on a local network.
It contains two sub-layers:
a.Logical Link Control Layer
It is responsible for transferring the packets to the Network layer of the receiver that is receiving.
It identifies the address of the network layer protocol from the header.
It also provides flow control.
b.Media Access Control Layer
A Media access control layer is a link between the Logical Link Control layer and the network's physical layer.
It is used for transferring the packets over the network.

3.Network Layer:

Transport Layer protocols.
The transport layer is represented by two protocols: TCP and UDP.
UDP:
UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol.
UDP is a simple protocol and it provides nonsequenced transport functionality.
UDP is a connectionless protocol.
This type of protocol is used when reliability and security are less important than speed and size.

TCP
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.
It provides full transport layer services to applications.
It is a connection-oriented protocol means the connection established between both the ends of the transmission. For creating the connection, TCP generates a virtual circuit between sender and receiver for the duration of a transmission.


Applicstion Layer Protocols:

Http:
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
It is a protocol used to access the data on the World Wide Web (www).
The HTTP protocol can be used to transfer the data in the form of plain text, hypertext, audio, video, and so on.
HTTP is similar to the FTP as it also transfers the files from one host to another host.

Ftp:
FTP stands for File transfer protocol.
FTP is a standard internet protocol provided by TCP/IP used for transmitting the files from one host to another.
It is also used for downloading the files to computer from other servers.

Smtp:
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
SMTP is a set of communication guidelines that allow software to transmit an electronic mail over the internet is called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
It is a program used for sending messages to other computer users based on e-mail addresses.
It can send a single message to one or more recipients.
Sending message can include text, voice, video or graphics.

Ssh:
SSH stands for Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell. It is a cryptographic network protocol that allows two computers to communicate and share the data over an insecure network such as the internet. It is used to login to a remote server to execute commands and data transfer from one machine to another machine.
